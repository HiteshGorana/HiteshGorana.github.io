### Who am I

[comment]: <> (My name is Lei Mao. I am a master student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. My research interests are mainly in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and partly in the area of data science. )

[comment]: <> (Before I went to the University of Chicago, I was a PhD candidate in the Department of Biochemistry at Duke University. I also graduated with a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from Dalian University of Technology in China.)

[comment]: <> (I am a perfectionist. I want to solve the problems in my hands in perfect ways, which is, however, not achievable in many situations.)

### Career Change

[comment]: <> (I believe I am a true scientist. However, I was not convinced that biology could be considered as "science" at the current level of human civilization when I was at Duke University. That is part of the motivations which causes me to leave this field. I should be thankful that I have learned math and programming well in college, and I met machine learning when I was at the lowest point of my life. )

[comment]: <> (With the help from MOOC, I was able to quickly catch up. I have done a good number of elementary machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence and data science projects indepedently. So I would like to challenge myself more by doing some state-of-art machine learning and artificial intelligence researches. I am currently seeking machine learning and artificial intelligence research opportunities not only in the University of Chicago but also in the other areas in the United States.)
